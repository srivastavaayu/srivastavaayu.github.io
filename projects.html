							<h5 id="project5">Academic Management System</h5>
							<p class="text-justify">An Academic Management System is an online system which enables streamlining of academic activities in an academic institution. The aim was to increase consistency in academic activities (for eg. conducting examinations of students, notifying students by broadcasting important information, displaying a dashboard for all students to track their academic activities in their current academic year) so as to increase efficiency of admins and employees by allowing them to focus on more important work. This web-app is developed to work regardless of any scale, be it on a tiny scale of a school or a huge scale of a university.<br>
