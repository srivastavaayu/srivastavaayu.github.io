							<h5 id="project5">Academic Management System</h5>
							<p class="text-justify">An Academic Management System is an online system which enables streamlining of academic activities in an academic institution. The aim was to increase consistency in academic activities (for eg. conducting examinations of students, notifying students by broadcasting important information, displaying a dashboard for all students to track their academic activities in their current academic year) so as to increase efficiency of admins and employees by allowing them to focus on more important work. This web-app is developed to work regardless of any scale, be it on a tiny scale of a school or a huge scale of a university.<br>

                            <h5 id="project4">To-Do and Notes App</h5>
							<p class="text-justify">
								A To-Do and Notes Application is a task management and note-taking application to help users stay organized and
								manage
								their day-to-day tasks. This app brings together the power of two applications, a To-Do tasks manager, and a Notes
								manager, into a single app so that the user does not have to migrate to different application for trivial tasks.
								This
								application uses the power of Android's Room Persistence Library to store persistent data of the application. Some
								important functionalities like reminders for incomplete tasks, copy to clipboard have also been implemented in this
								application.
								Note: This application is currently only available for Android. iOS and other OS are not supported.

								Features of To-Do and Notes Application:
							<ol class="text-justify">
								<li>Add, modify and delete to-do tasks and notes: The application gives you the option to add, modify and remove
									to-do tasks and notes. You can edit tasks and notes if you want to change them.</li>
								<li>Reminders with alarms: The application notifies you of deadlines you set for your to-do tasks.</li>
								<li>Persistent Storage: The application uses the power of Android's Room Persistence Library to store app data like
									tasks and notes so that data is stored even when the application is not running. The application also uses
									Android's SharedPreferences for trivial information about the user of the application.</li>
								<li>Copy to clipboard: The application gives you a context menu when you short-press on a to-do task or note but it
									copies the task info or note to clipboard when you long-press on a to-do task or note.</li>
